				<h2>About the Owner</h2>
				<p>
					One James Bond superfan has turned his passion for all-things-007 into a full-fledged tourist attraction. 
                    The James Bond Museum in the Swedish city of Nybro has everything to make any 007 fan swoon. James Bond Gunnar Schäfer 
                    (yes, that is the name of the founder of this museum) has amassed a collection of over 60,000 items.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					His passion for James Bond all began when he was 7 years old and was taken to the cinema to watch “Goldfinger”. 
					However, behind his passion lies the fate of a man who is still searching for his father.When Gunnar Schäfer was two years old, 
					his father mysteriously disappeared without a trace, and no one knew what had happened to him.
					Through Ian Fleming, the Bond author, and James Bond, the young boy found an imaginary father figure. 
					He created a vision of what his father’s life may have looked like and imagined that he was on a secret mission 
					like James Bond. Today, Schäfer is still searching for his father and trying to fathom his past and finding its roots.
